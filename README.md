# Chat bubble web app

Chat bubble web app intended to be used in videos built in React.js. The background acts as a green screen which can be filtered out in the video editing process.  

The web app replicates the web app created by [DevAsLife](https://www.devas.life/) which has since become unavailable. 

* Start recording the screen with the web app open
* Type messages
* Crop out the green screen in the video editing process
